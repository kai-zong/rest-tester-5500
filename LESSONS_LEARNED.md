# Lessons Learned Template

This document captures lessons learned from using different programming languages in our project.

## Language 1: GO

### What Did We Learn About This Language?

- Compared with Java and PHP, go is much simpler and lightweight to run the server, and the code is much cleaner.

### Interesting Problems Encountered

- The interesting thing however, is that we didn't run into any problem during the task, except CORS issue, which is universal in all servers. Go is much appreciated compared to following languages.

## Language 2: Ruby

### What Did We Learn About This Language?

- Like Go, Ruby is simple to set up and manage dependencies, while it looks more like SQL.

### Interesting Problems Encountered

- The issue was encoutered during MacOS installation, where severall paths needed to be added to allow the latest version of ruby to be used and other configurations to be set.

## Language 3: Java and PHP

### What Did We Learn About This Language?

- Java is so complex, which requires a build process and XML config file. PHP is simpler but the bug is challenging to fix.

### Interesting Problems Encountered

- VSCode doesn't seem to be the right IDE for building a Java project and server, and there are too many dependencies and extensions are required. For PHP, we have a bug for adding a user, while other operations worked well.

## General Reflections

- Different languages have their own syntax, and it takes considerable effort to learn and use one language for a basic task.

- Backend and Frontend can be separated cleanly, allowing servers to be built with many various languages without affecting the frontend.

### Key Takeaways

- Seeking help from generative AI for some rough ideas and explanations, but a well-written documentation is ultimately more helpful.

- Choose the most appropriate languages for the project. For example, go or python would be better to use to build a server in this assignment.

### Future Improvements

- Keep an overall idea about what each language is good at, which will help to save time and effort when we try to select the most suited one to a task.
